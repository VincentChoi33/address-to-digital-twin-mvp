# NVIDIA-only Omniverse migration track

This repository now has a concrete NVIDIA-targeted export path in addition to the browser MVP.
The browser/Three.js viewer remains useful for fast local iteration, but the NVIDIA-only target is:

```text
Juso/VWorld/WFS twin.json
  → OpenUSD stage
  → NVIDIA Omniverse / RTX Renderer / ovrtx viewer
  → SimReady material + physics assignment
  → Omniverse Asset Validator / USD Performance Tuning
  → optional cuOpt / NuRec / AI-Q layers
```

## Implemented in this repo

- `src/nvidia/usd.ts`
  - Converts `TwinProject + SourceManifest` to an OpenUSD ASCII stage.
  - Authors `metersPerUnit = 1`, `upAxis = "Y"`, `defaultPrim`, `UsdPreviewSurface` materials, `MaterialBindingAPI`, official building meshes, official road ribbons, parcel boundary ribbon, terrain reference plane, and flood-water reference layer.
- `src/nvidia/exportOmniversePackage.ts`
  - Writes a deterministic package under `src/samples/sadang_317_6/omniverse/`.
  - Probes local NVIDIA/USD runtime gates.
  - Runs `usdchecker` when available and writes `usdchecker_report.txt`.
- Web app artifact links
  - Every generated twin now exposes `omniverse.usda`, `nvidia_stack_manifest.json`, and `simready_minimum_report.json` as downloadable blobs.

## Generated Sadang package

```text
src/samples/sadang_317_6/omniverse/
  sadang_317_6.usda
  nvidia_stack_manifest.json
  simready_minimum_report.json
  usdchecker_report.txt
  README.md
```

Current generated evidence:

- 17 official building meshes.
- 8 official road meshes.
- Official parcel boundary ribbon.
- Meter-based Y-up OpenUSD stage.
- Local `usdchecker` exit code 0 (`Validation Result ... Success!`).
- Local NVIDIA GPU/ovrtx runtime is not present on this Mac, so RTX rendering and full SimReady validation remain external runtime gates.

## NVIDIA product mapping

| NVIDIA product / stack | Role in this project | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenUSD | Canonical scene interchange replacing ad-hoc browser geometry exports | Implemented |
| NVIDIA Omniverse / RTX Renderer / ovrtx | Final NVIDIA viewer/render path for USD | Runtime-gated; no local NVIDIA GPU |
| NVIDIA SimReady | Simulation-ready material/physics/profile target | Minimum candidate metadata authored; full conformance requires runtime validation |
| Omniverse Content Agents | Material/physics assignment | Planned; requires NVIDIA_API_KEY, Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, GPU or service endpoints |
| Omniverse USD Performance Tuning / Asset Validator / Scene Optimizer | Stage validation, profiling, optimization | `usdchecker` local pass; full Omniverse validator pending |
| NVIDIA cuOpt | Emergency response/inspection/dispatch route optimization | Planned after operational data exists |
| NVIDIA Physical AI Neural Reconstruction / NuRec | Replace preview massing with reconstructed assets from camera/LiDAR/radar recordings | Planned; requires sensor captures |
| NVIDIA AI-Q / NIM / Dynamo | Agentic orchestration and scalable inference around data collection/export/validation | Planned for deployment pipeline, not needed for static USD export |

## Next hard gates for a true NVIDIA-only runtime

1. Run the generated `.usda` on an NVIDIA workstation/container with Omniverse or `ovrtx`.
2. Replace the browser-side 3D viewport with an Omniverse/ovstream viewer path. NVIDIA viewer guidance explicitly forbids substituting browser-side WebGL as the final USD renderer.
3. Run Content Agents material and physics assignment.
4. Run SimReady/Asset Validator gates and persist their reports.
5. Run USD Performance Tuning baseline/after profiling when scene complexity grows.
6. Add cuOpt only when there is real routing/dispatch optimization data.
7. Add NuRec only when camera/LiDAR/radar captures exist.
